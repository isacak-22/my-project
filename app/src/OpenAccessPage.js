          Isac Research Library follows a full open access publishing model
          based on the principles of the Budapest, Berlin, and Bethesda
          declarations. We ensure that all scholarly articles are freely
          accessible to researchers, students, and professionals worldwide.
        </p>

       <p className="hi">
          This means that all articles published in SSRG International journals, including data, graphics, and supplements, can be linked from external sources, scanned by search engines, re-used by text mining applications or websites, blogs, etc. free of charge under the sole condition of proper accreditation of the source and original publisher. SSRG believes that open access publishing fosters the exchange of research results amongst scientists from different disciplines, thus facilitating interdisciplinary research. Open access publishing also provides access to research results to researchers worldwide, including those from developing countries and an interested general public. Although SSRG publishes all of its journals under the open-access model, we believe that open access is an enriching part of the scholarly communication process that can and should co-exist with other forms of communication and publication, such as society-based publishing and conferencing activities.
